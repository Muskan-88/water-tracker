# CLI Water Intake Tracker

## What I Created
This project is a **Water Intake Tracker** application that helps users track their daily water intake. The application allows users to set a daily water goal and log how many cups of water they’ve consumed throughout the day. It is built using Python and stores data in a JSON file, so your progress is saved even after closing the program.

## What It Allows the User to Do
- **Track daily water intake**: Log how many cups of water you've consumed each day.
- **Set a daily water goal**: You can set your own goal for daily water intake.
- **View progress**: The app calculates and shows the percentage of your daily goal that you’ve achieved.
- **Reset the daily total**: If you need to start over, you can reset your daily water total.
- **Change the goal**: You can adjust the goal anytime if needed.

## What I Have Left to Do
- **Automated Testing**: Implement test cases to ensure the core functionality is working correctly.
- **Create a GUI**: Design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the app more user-friendly.
- **Notifications:** Add reminders to prompt users to drink water.
- **Reward System:** Add incentive for users to reach their daily goal, such as colour or theme customization.
